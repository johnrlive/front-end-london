      <h2>What to expect</h2>
      <p>Great, focussed talks by some of the best front-end developers in London. Topped off with beer and pizza and an obligatory trip to the local pub to boot.</p>

      <p>We'll also be having a Q&amp;A session with the speakers, on a particular topic decided every month and we might even have some other little special talks / interviews to make it an even better event.</p>

    <p>We're inviting the front-end community to submit proposals for the Front-end London day event. The event will take place around the end of <strong>August / beginning of September</strong> and as soon as we've finalised a date we'll let you know.</p>

    <p>We're interested in hearing proposals from anybody, <em>even if you've never spoken before</em>. Primarily we're looking for topics that will excite us and that we'd love to hear a talk about (we're developers too).</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Topics</h2>

    <p>The topics we're interested in hearing about are vast (see our previous speakers / talks over at Lanyard) they include, but are not limited to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Javascript</li>
      <li>CSS / Sass / LESS</li>
      <li>Performance</li>
      <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
      <li>Tools / Best practises / Process</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We aim to be on the cutting edge of front-end and have had some fantastic and thought provoking speakers previously and we'd love to carry on that trend with this event. We're aiming to bring the Front-end London experience to a larger audience in a unique location.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Details</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Talks are usually 30 minutes long</strong>, with time allowed between for Q&A.</li>
      <li>We're aiming for 6 speakers on the day, if we can fit in more we will.</li>
      <li>The event will be held in London (Exact location TBA).</li>
      <li>We may be able to cover your travel expenses, please get in touch.</li>
    </ul>

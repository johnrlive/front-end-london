        <p class="speaker-topic">How did you discover that you wanted to be a front end developer? For most of you it was in your spare time that you developed a passion for coding. Why don't schools offer a chance for kids to learn how to code?</p>

        <p class="speaker-topic">Josh has been running an after school coding club, or <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a>, at a primary school in Brighton. He'll talk about how Code Club came to be, why it's awesome and show some of the amazing things his kids have created.</p>
